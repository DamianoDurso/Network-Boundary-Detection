Americans were able to send astronauts like Neil Armstrong to the moon before finding the Titanic. (2) There are many obstacles to exploring the bottom of the ocean. (3) First, scientists need to be persistent. It is very difficult to see the bottom of the ocean. Scientists needed to create new inventions to find the Titanic. (4) Second, the voyage to the bottom of the ocean is hard for people. Scientists need to build new equipment that can withstand the water pressure far below the surface of the water. (5) One solution is to experiment with new equipment. In 1985, scientists from different countries designed an underwater camera called Argo. (6) Argo was an ingenious invention. It was like a human eyeball. On August 31, 1985, Argo's cameras took a picture of a huge piece of equipment. It was the boilers that burned coal to drive a ship's engines.

In primates, the heart sends oxygen in the blood all around the body. The body must have oxygen to function properly. The strong heart muscle contracts to pump blood all around the body. A healthy heart never rests. (2) But what happens when a person's heart gets weaker? People with weak hearts need help. Scientists have to study a medical mystery. Then they might be able to help people. (3) First, scientists need to diagnose the reasons that a human heart gets weak. They need to do tests. But sometimes it would be hard on a sick person to have tests done. So, scientists study animals that have body systems like humans. Scientists knew that the structure of the macaque monkey's heart is like the human heart. So, they did tests with macaque monkeys. The scientists learned what happens when a monkey has a heart attack. After a heart attack, the monkey's heart muscle has scar tissue where it as damaged. The scar tissue cannot contract like a strong heart muscle can. Then the monkey's heart cannot pump enough blood to give the body the oxygen it needs. Without enough oxygen, the monkey's body cannot function properly. (4) Second, scientists wanted to try out new solutions that would keep the heart working. Sometimes the new solutions might fail. So, scientists didn't want to try the solutions with people right away. They tried a solution with macaque monkeys. (5) Scientists developed an idea. Then, they tested an idea. They injected human stem cells from the human heart into the monkey's heart. After four weeks the human heart cells grew where the monkey's scar tissue was. After three months, the monkey's heart got stronger. (6) Now scientists are using what they found in this experiment to help humans who have had heart attacks.","According to paragraph 3, why do scientists study macaque monkeys?","A","Their heart muscles have scar tissue",NA,"gilbert_meta_1","gilbert_meta_1","D","gilbert_meta_1","Child (<18y)","Child (6-12y)","Educational","Cognitive/educational","Observational rating","Mixed","bra","Modeling Item-Level Heterogeneous Treatment Effects With the Explanatory Item Response Model: Leveraging Large-Scale Online Assessments to Pinpoint the Impact of Educational Interventions","gilbert_meta_1","10.7910/DVN/QARRYT","Replication Data for: Modeling Item-Level Heterogeneous Treatment Effects With the Explanatory Item Response Model: Leveraging Large-Scale Online Assessments to Pinpoint the Impact of Educational Interventions","2023","Josh Gilbert"

But sometimes it would be hard on a sick person to have tests done. So, scientists study animals that have body systems like humans. Scientists knew that the structure of the macaque monkey's heart is like the human heart. So, they did tests with macaque monkeys. The scientists learned what happens when a monkey has a heart attack. After a heart attack, the monkey's heart muscle has scar tissue where it as damaged. The scar tissue cannot contract like a strong heart muscle can. Then the monkey's heart cannot pump enough blood to give the body the oxygen it needs. Without enough oxygen, the monkey's body cannot function properly. (4) Second, scientists wanted to try out new solutions that would keep the heart working. Sometimes the new solutions might fail. So, scientists didn't want to try the solutions with people right away. They tried a solution with macaque monkeys. (5) Scientists developed an idea. Then, they tested an idea. They injected human stem cells from the human heart into the monkey's heart. After four weeks the human heart cells grew where the monkey's scar tissue was. After three months, the monkey's heart got stronger. (6) Now scientists are using what they found in this experiment to help humans who have had heart attacks.","Why do scientists study monkey hearts?","A","Because they want to help humans who have heart attacks",NA,"gilbert_meta_1","gilbert_meta_1","A","gilbert_meta_1","Child (<18y)","Child (6-12y)","Educational","Cognitive/educational","Observational rating","Mixed","bra","Modeling Item-Level Heterogeneous Treatment Effects With the Explanatory Item Response Model: Leveraging Large-Scale Online Assessments to Pinpoint the Impact of Educational Interventions","gilbert_meta_1","10.7910/DVN/QARRYT","Replication Data for: Modeling Item-Level Heterogeneous Treatment Effects With the Explanatory Item Response Model: Leveraging Large-Scale Online Assessments to Pinpoint the Impact of Educational Interventions","2023","Josh Gilbert"

There are 4 answer choices for each question but only one correct answer. Choose the answer that you think is correct. You may begin.","Some birds that are here today are smaller than they were many years ago. Why is this happening? It is a mystery. How do scientists study a mystery? First, scientists try to understand the bird’s skeletal and muscular systems. Those systems help birds to fly. One thing scientists know is that birds’ bones are hollow inside. So, they don’t weigh much. Birds’ skeletons weigh less than their feathers. They have also learned that a bird wing works like a human arm. Birds contract their chest muscles to make their wings flap. Second, scientists try to diagnose the reasons that the birds’ bodies might have changed over time. Some scientists thought that birds’ skeletal or muscular systems might have changed. So, they studied migratory birds in North America. Migratory birds fly long distances to warmer places for the winter. Third, scientists measured the physical characteristics of the birds. They measured the size of the birds’ bones. They found some of the birds’ bones were shorter than they were 40 years ago. For example, the lower leg bone of many birds is smaller. Fourth, scientists measured the migratory birds’ wings. They found the birds’ wings are longer than they used to be. Many scientists asked, “Why are the birds’ bones smaller than they used be. But their wings are longer?” They thought about the long distance the birds fly in winter. They thought that the birds’ bodies changed to adapt to the long winter flight. They would need a lot of energy for the flight. A smaller body would have smaller muscles and less fat. But smaller bones and longer wings would make flying easier. Over time, these characteristics of birds have become more common. The scientists came up with some very good ideas about why these skeletal changes might be occurring.","What is the main question that scientists are trying to answer in this passage?","A","How do birds fly long distances?",NA,"gilbert_meta_8","gilbert_meta_8","B","gilbert_meta_8","Child (<18y)","Child (6-12y)","Educational","Cognitive/educational","Test","Likert Scale/selected response","eng","Domain-Specific (Science) Reading Comprehension","gilbert_meta_8","10.7910/DVN/RKBVKY","Replication Data for: Time to Transfer: Long-Term Effects of a Sustained and Spiraled Content Literacy Intervention in the Elementary Grades","2023","James S Kim and Joshua B.

They have bones that keep it tall and strong and skin to protect the body. They have a command center that is like a brain. How do engineers design and build strong and smart skyscrapers? It is very challenging to build a skyscraper because there are many parts that have to work together. If one part is broken, the skyscraper will not work properly. First, engineers need a strong and tall frame that supports the floors and walls. This frame is like the bones of a skyscraper. The bones of a skyscraper are made of concrete, steel and other materials. The columns are like the backbone of a human body. The columns go up. The steel columns hold up each floor. There are also steel beams that go across each floor. The steel columns and beams must be strong to resist the force of gravity. The steel columns and beams must work together to form a strong backbone. Second, engineers need to design a command center. The command center is a computer that sends signals through wires in a skyscraper. For example, it sends signals to help bring fresh air into rooms, just like your lungs. The command center also controls the heating and air conditioning. It helps the building cool down when it’s too hot and warm up when it’s too cold. A skyscraper has many different parts that work together. The bones make the building tall and strong. The skin protects the inside of the building. The skin of a skyscraper can be made of metal, stone, or glass. The brain controls the building temperature. The anatomy of a skyscraper is like a human body. All the parts have to work together. That's how a city skyscraper works properly.","What does the author think is special about the beams and columns of a skyscraper?","A","They are made of many different materials",NA,"gilbert_meta_8","gilbert_meta_8","C","gilbert_meta_8","Child (<18y)","Child (6-12y)","Educational","Cognitive/educational","Test","Likert Scale/selected response","eng","Domain-Specific (Science) Reading Comprehension","gilbert_meta_8","10.7910/DVN/RKBVKY","Replication Data for: Time to Transfer: Long-Term Effects of a Sustained and Spiraled Content Literacy Intervention in the Elementary Grades","2023","James S Kim and Joshua B.

In primates, the heart sends oxygen in the blood all around the body. The body must have oxygen to function properly. The strong heart muscle contracts to pump blood all around the body.

First, scientists need to diagnose the reasons that a human heart gets weak. They need to do tests. But sometimes it would be hard on a sick person to have tests done. So, scientists study animals that have body systems like humans. Scientists knew that the macaque monkey’s heart is similar to the human heart. So, they did tests with macaque monkeys. The scientists learned what happens when a monkey has a heart attack. After a heart attack, the monkey’s heart muscle has scar tissue where it was damaged. The scar tissue cannot contract like a strong heart muscle can. Then the monkey’s heart cannot pump enough blood to give the body the oxygen it needs. Without enough oxygen, the monkey’s body cannot function properly. Second, scientists wanted to try out new solutions that would keep the heart working. Sometimes the new solutions might fail. So, scientists didn’t want to try the solutions with people right away. They tried a solution with macaque monkeys. Scientists developed an idea. Then, they tested an idea. They injected human stem cells from the human heart into the monkey’s heart. After four weeks the human heart cells grew where the monkey’s scar tissue was.

First, scientists try to understand the bird’s skeletal and muscular systems. Those systems help birds to fly. One thing scientists know is that birds’ bones are hollow inside. So, they don’t weigh much. Birds’ skeletons weigh less than their feathers. They have also learned that a bird wing works like a human arm. Birds contract their chest muscles to make their wings flap. Second, scientists try to diagnose the reasons that the birds’ bodies might have changed over time.

They found some of the birds’ bones were shorter than they were 40 years ago. For example, the lower leg bone of many birds is smaller. Fourth, scientists measured the migratory birds’ wings. They found the birds’ wings are longer than they used to be. Many scientists asked, “Why are the birds’ bones smaller than they used be.

First, scientists try to understand the bird’s skeletal and muscular systems. Those systems help birds to fly. One thing scientists know is that birds’ bones are hollow inside. So, they don’t weigh much. Birds’ skeletons weigh less than their feathers. They have also learned that a bird wing works like a human arm. Birds contract their chest muscles to make their wings flap. Second, scientists try to diagnose the reasons that the birds’ bodies might have changed over time. Some scientists thought that birds’ skeletal or muscular systems might have changed. So, they studied migratory birds in North America. Migratory birds fly long distances to warmer places for the winter. Third, scientists measured the physical characteristics of the birds. They measured the size of the birds’ bones. They found some of the birds’ bones were shorter than they were 40 years ago. For example, the lower leg bone of many birds is smaller. Fourth, scientists measured the migratory birds’ wings. They found the birds’ wings are longer than they used to be. Many scientists asked, “Why are the birds’ bones smaller than they used be. But their wings are longer?” They thought about the long distance the birds fly in winter. They thought that the birds’ bodies changed to adapt to the long winter flight. They would need a lot of energy for the flight. A smaller body would have smaller muscles and less fat. But smaller bones and longer wings would make flying easier.

They have bones that keep it tall and strong and skin to protect the body. They have a command center that is like a brain. How do engineers design and build strong and smart skyscrapers? It is very challenging to build a skyscraper because there are many parts that have to work together. If one part is broken, the skyscraper will not work properly. First, engineers need a strong and tall frame that supports the floors and walls. This frame is like the bones of a skyscraper. The bones of a skyscraper are made of concrete, steel and other materials. The columns are like the backbone of a human body. The columns go up. The steel columns hold up each floor. There are also steel beams that go across each floor. The steel columns and beams must be strong to resist the force of gravity. The steel columns and beams must work together to form a strong backbone. Second, engineers need to design a command center. The command center is a computer that sends signals through wires in a skyscraper. For example, it sends signals to help bring fresh air into rooms, just like your lungs. The command center also controls the heating and air conditioning. It helps the building cool down when it’s too hot and warm up when it’s too cold. A skyscraper has many different parts that work together. The bones make the building tall and strong. The skin protects the inside of the building. The skin of a skyscraper can be made of metal, stone, or glass. The brain controls the building temperature. The anatomy of a skyscraper is like a human body. All the parts have to work together.

First, scientists need to diagnose the reasons that a human heart gets weak. They need to do tests. But sometimes it would be hard on a sick person to have tests done. So, scientists study animals that have body systems like humans. Scientists knew that the macaque monkey’s heart is similar to the human heart. So, they did tests with macaque monkeys. The scientists learned what happens when a monkey has a heart attack. After a heart attack, the monkey’s heart muscle has scar tissue where it was damaged. The scar tissue cannot contract like a strong heart muscle can. Then the monkey’s heart cannot pump enough blood to give the body the oxygen it needs. Without enough oxygen, the monkey’s body cannot function properly. Second, scientists wanted to try out new solutions that would keep the heart working. Sometimes the new solutions might fail. So, scientists didn’t want to try the solutions with people right away. They tried a solution with macaque monkeys. Scientists developed an idea. Then, they tested an idea.
