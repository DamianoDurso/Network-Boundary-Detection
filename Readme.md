# Readme for Repo

## Meeting July 1st:

### Update Jonas
- Did my minimal TODOs: add the DASS-21 dataset into the empirical data structure
- Question: need a way to get informative unique IDs for both questions and datasets; now it's still a bit awkward

Next steps:
- Set up definition for unique IDs for datasets and questions
- Make pipeline: taking all datasets and corresponding items, compute cors in data and between embedding vectors, and put this into a forest plot
- Then: make a timeline for adding more and more data
