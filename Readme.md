# Readme for Repo

## Meeting July 7th:

### Update Jonas
Next steps:
- Scale IDs = Scale + source (for OpenPsychoemtrics = OP). E.g. DASS = "DASS_OP" . For papers, we use scale + author + year. E.g., DASS_AUTH_24.
- Use item IDs as Scale_+First three letters factor + item number. Eg. for item 1 in the DASS "DASS21_DEP_1"
- Make pipeline: 
    - taking all datasets and corresponding items, 
    - Pre-processs
    - Compute cors in data and between embedding vectors, 
    - Put this into a forest plot

### Damiano

- Output scale similarity matrices in the "Item_data/Processed Data" folder in json format 


- logbook

- Explain folders structure
- Explains processing logic
